1.     Class: A class is a blueprint or template that defines the structure (fields) and behavior (methods) of objects.

       Object: An object is an instance of a class that contains real values for the properties defined in the class.


3. Inheritance lets one class (child) inherit properties/methods from another class (parent).

       Types:
              Single
              Multilevel
              Hierarchical
              Multiple (via interfaces)
              Hybrid

âœ… 6. Difference Between Abstract Class and Interface
Feature   	      Abstract Class	                Interface
Methods 	  Can have concrete/abstract	     Only abstract (till Java 7), default/static in 8+
Inheritance	   Single inheritance	             Multiple inheritance
Constructor	      Can have	                     Cannot have
Variables	    Instance/Static	                 public static final only


7.   Abstraction is the process of hiding unnecessary implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.
     It helps in reducing complexity and increasing code readability and security.


 8. Polymorphism and Types
        Polymorphism = many forms
        Types: Compile-time (Method Overloading)
               Runtime (Method Overriding)


18. Encapsulation in Java means binding data and methods into a class and restricting direct access using access modifiers with getters and setters.
